        <p>DPRK is the abbreviation of Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also known as North Korea. My grandparents went to visit there before the pandemic and brought back some photos of real DPRK to me, which made me interested in this mysterious country.

        The kitsh, dramatic and orderly aesthetics of DPRK makes it one of a kind. This worldâ€™s most isolated, secretive country enables you to achieve a sense of the combination of western countries and eastern countries in the past and at the present. 

        This website is an online archive of the aesthetics of DPRK, including photpgraphy of some artists and articles collected online.</p>
