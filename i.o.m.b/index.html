    I.O.M.B shows my process of thinking around an imprint of the chairâ€™s fabric on my butt, which can be generally divided into two stages, respectively what design is and who we are. The chair is designed by human, and now it designs human back. Are we actually designing ourselves? Maybe we are designed all the time, and we are just not aware of it. And if we are designed, are we still the one we were? What defines us in this designed world? Besides, what I also want to tell that never overlook every single thing around us.
