            <p>The chair is designed by human, and now the chair designs human back in an unexpected way. We want our designs to serve us, but we never expect such side-effect would happen.</p>
            <p class="indent">If we see this occurrence from an overall point of view, are we, human, actually designing  ourselves?</p>
            <p>The second part of the project, “Self, who?” aims to address the question asked above, which would involve Martin Heidegger’s thoughts around the concept of ontology and how designers today embed ontology into design so as to find out how we, human are designed by who.</p>
            <p class="indent">Are we designed? How are we designed? We are designed by who? How to define ourselves in this designed world?</p>
            <p>Findings around the problems are presented in this part. There is no answer. It is all about asking questions, putting forward hypothesis and thinking.</p>
