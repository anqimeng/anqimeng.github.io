          <p>The chair unintentionally left an imprint of the polyester mesh fabric on me. It is a red and regular pattern, creating an unusual visual experience of human body and leaving the artificial texture on skin. Just like how we, human, leave the imprint on the objects and we call them design.</p>
          <p class="indent">In this unintentional and object-leading circumstances, am I a design by the chair?</p>
          <p>The first part of the project, “Un/intentional * In/Animate”, focuses on the two factors of design: intention and designer. </p>
          <p class="indent">Is unintentional visual result design? Does design have to be intentional? Does design have to be done by animate creatures? What about the unintentional design by inanimate objects, just like the imprint left by the chair on my skin?</p>
          <p>This is an archive of my thinking  process and understanding around the unintentional and the inanimate in design, including articles, photography, and my own experiment.</p>
