          <p class="indent">Apart from the two concepts discussed in the first two parts, the final point I want to talk about in this part is not to overlook the surroundings.

          <p class="indent">No matter whether the story of Newton and apple is true or not, people can get inspired that those things we see everyday are more than what we see. The imprint is more than just an imprint.</p>
